# TODOs

## Tecnhiques

- [ ] Min hashing
- [ ] LSH nearest neighbor search
- [ ] K-means clustering standard
- [ ] Clustroids instead of centroids
- [ ] Recommendation systems
- [ ] BFR clustering (normally distributed clusters around centroids in Euclidean space) **PROBABLY NOT**
- [ ] CURE clustering (non-convex clusters in Euclidean space) **PROBABLY NOT**
- [ ] DBSCAN clustering (arbitrary shaped clusters in Euclidean space) **MANDATORY**
- [ ] Content-based recommendation systems
- Dimensionality reduction (on feature matrix)
  - [ ] SVD


## Distance functions

- [ ] Euclidean distance using raw feature vectors
- [ ] Edit distance


## Modifications

- [ ] Use of a different dataset where the divergence is driver-dependent
